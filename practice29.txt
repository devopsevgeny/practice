1. Set the password for serena to hunter2.
 sudo bash -c 'echo "serena:hunter2" | chpasswd'
or sudo passwd serena

2. Also set a password for venus and then lock the venus user account with usermod. Verify
the locking in /etc/shadow before and after you lock it.
  jeka-VirtualBox  jeka  ~  CLASS  sudo bash -c 'echo "venus:hunter2" | chpasswd'
sudo cat /etc/shadow | grep venus
venus:!$y$j9T$Noof6VzOioLvCB0l/9Mpm.$Fsp39xPc6kXz3oYXKfxZzWvFeGCiVn1EeODgU8jee/9:20143:0:99999:7:::

After lock appeas !before the password

3. Use passw -d to disable the serena password. Verify the serena line in /etc/shadow
 before and after disabling.

  jeka-VirtualBox  jeka  ~  CLASS  sudo bash -c 'echo "serena:hunter2" | chpasswd'
  jeka-VirtualBox  jeka  ~  CLASS  sudo cat /etc/shadow | grep serena
serena:$y$j9T$diPHgUUZUU5VGb..twlhx.$QEqtNCCdIeLbgInyCgEkqzxwcvDfOq7jJB23G1UrSs1:20143:0:99999:7:::
  jeka-VirtualBox  jeka  ~  CLASS  sudo passwd -d serena
passwd: password changed.
  jeka-VirtualBox  jeka  ~  CLASS  sudo cat /etc/shadow | grep serena
serena::20143:0:99999:7:::


4. What is the difference between locking a user account and disabling a user account's
password like we just did with usermod -L and passwd -d?

Looks like locking user account will delete the password ,whwn lock only adds !

5. Try changing the password of serena to serena as serena.
su - serena, I was able to login with user that has sudo permission without any password.
and I was able to change password as serena 

6. Make sure serena has to change her password in 10 days.
chage -M 10 serena

7. Make sure every new user needs to change their password every 10 days
PASS_MAX_DAYS   99999 shoud ne changed to PASS_MAX_DAYS  10.

8. Take a backup as root of /etc/shadow. Use vi to copy an encrypted hunter2 hash from
venus to serena. Can serena now log on with hunter2 as a password ?
yes
9. Why use vipw instead of vi ? What could be the problem when using vi or vim ?
Special tools for editing passwd / shadow datanase  
10. Use chsh to list all shells (only works on RHEL/CentOS/Fedora), and compare to cat /
etc/shells.
 chsh -s /
/bin/bash        /bin/rbash       /bin/sh          /usr/bin/bash    /usr/bin/ksh93   /usr/bin/rksh93  /usr/bin/sh      /usr/bin/zsh
/bin/ksh93       /bin/rksh93      /bin/zsh         /usr/bin/dash    /usr/bin/rbash   /usr/bin/screen  /usr/bin/tmux

with tab worked as well in Linux mint 
 cat /etc/shells
# /etc/shells: valid login shells
/bin/sh
/usr/bin/sh
/bin/bash
/usr/bin/bash
/bin/rbash
/usr/bin/rbash
/usr/bin/dash
/usr/bin/screen
/usr/bin/tmux
/bin/zsh
/usr/bin/zsh
/usr/bin/zsh
/bin/ksh93
/usr/bin/ksh93
/bin/rksh93
/usr/bin/rksh93

11. Which useradd option allows you to name a home directory ?
useradd -m 

12. How can you see whether the password of user serena is locked or unlocked ? Give a
solution with grep and a solution with passwd.
-S, --status
Display account status information. 
The status information consists of 7 fields. The first field is the user's login name. 
The second field indicates if the user account has
a locked password (L), has no password (NP), or has a usable password (P). 
The third field gives the date of the last password change. The next four fields are the minimum
age, maximum age, warning period, and inactivity period for the password. These ages are expressed in days.

sudo cat /etc/shadow | grep user
